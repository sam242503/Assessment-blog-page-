    <p><b>We believe everyone should have access to good food - food that is affordable, sustainable, nutritious,
            high-quality, and culturally connected. We also know that there is no true equity in society without health
            equity, and that there is no health equity without Food Equity. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            We operate under the assumption that good food is an important catalyst for good health, and that every
            family in America should have access to good food. Through our work, we have identified three pillars
            necessary to support Food Equity:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p style="color: black;">A healthy food supply, in both public and private sectors, and through the
                        charitable system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="color: black;">Access to affordable, good food in all communities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="color: black;">Awareness, knowledge and skills that empower people everywhere to select
                        good foods and to quickly
                        prepare them at home.</p>
                </li>
            </ol> </b></p>

            <p><b> The pandemic has laid bare shocking and systemic inequities in America, including the reality that vast
            differences in life expectancy, incidence of disease, and other measures of health are often determined by
            where you live, income, race, education, and other “social determinants.” <br>
            <br>
            At the Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA), we know that there cannot be Health Equity without Food
            Equity. Poor nutrition is a principal cause for a host of diet-related diseases, including diabetes, heart
            disease, obesity, cancers, hypertension, and more. At its core, Food Equity means that EVERY family, EVERY
            person, in the United States has ready and affordable access to healthy, sustainable food. <br>
                <br>
            Today, as many as 40 million Americans lack affordable access to healthy, sustainable food with devastating
            and predictable consequences. PHA, through our programs and partnerships, is committed to making Food Equity
            a reality. <br>
                <br>
            We need your voice and your actions in building a national movement for Food Equity. It can be done. It must
            be done. The time is now. <br>
                <br>
            When you join us today and sign our pledge to Fight for Food Equity in America, we’ll send you actions that
            you can take to help achieve our shared goal. <br>
